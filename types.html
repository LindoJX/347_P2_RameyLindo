			<h4> There are many forms of climbing </h4>
			While climbing can be split into two main forms (roped and unroped), there are a multitude of different climbing <br>
			types. From traditional (also called trad) to sport, to top-rope, to ice, to alpine, to mixed, and even more. I'm <br>
			not going to get into all of the forms of climbing here, but I will get into trad, top rope, and bouldering. <br>

			  <div class="text"><h4> Trad climbing </h4>
				Traditional climbing is pretty much the OG type of climbing. Usually, a climber on a trad route will have tons of <br>
				safety gear, ranging from cams and hexes to nuts, chocks, and tricams. That's on top of the rope and clips that a <br> 
				sport climber might employ. All of this gear makes trad climbing one of the harder types of climbing to get into, <br>
				and certainly the hardest on this list.<br></div>

				<div class="text"><h4> Top rope </h4>
					Top rope climbing involves an anchor at the top of the route and an extra person called a belayer, who basically <br>
					catches the climber in the event of a fall. The climber gets clipped or tied into the rop, which goes all the way <br>
					up to the anchor and back down to the belayer, who usually stands some distance away from the wall. In the event that<br>
					the climber falls (whether it be from a slip or a failed dyno), the belayer uses their own bodyweight to catch them. <br>
					This precludes the need for most of the gear used by trad climbers. <br></div>

				<div class="text"><h4> Bouldering </h4>
					Bouldering may be one of the easiest climbing disciplines to get into. As the name implies, it just involves large rocks<br>
					or boulders. The common pieces of equipment used in bouldering are crash pads (which are basically just big mattresses) <br>
					and climbing shoes (it should be noted that climbing shoes are common for the previous couple types of climbing). The <br>
					magnitude (or lack thereof) of gear needed to boulder is one of the biggest attractors to bouldering in my mind. Now, some <br>
					may rightfully wonder how it's safe to climb without a rope to break your fall. The answer to this is twofold. The <br>
					aforementioned crash pad cushions any fall, and bouldering routes (called problems instead) are usually less than a few<br>
					meters. The tallest bouldering problems are about 10 meters, or about 30 feet. Competetive bouldering ensurest that the <br>
					climber will not go above about 3 meters, or about 10 feet. <br></div>
