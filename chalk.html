			The climbers of old would usually use dry chalks, but the new-age climbers are tending toward liquid chalks. <br>
			Whether it be because of the more convenient packaging, or less messy use, liquid chalks are becoming more and<br>
			more popular. That is not, however, to say that dry chalks are completely out of the question. Those are <br>
			especially useful when doing longer sends that may require a mid-send chalk-up.

			Chalk is one of the first things that a budding climber needs to invest in. There are a few different types <br>
			of climbing chalk. There's liquid, loose (Also called dry), block, and cream chalk. But first, why use chalk anyway? <br>
			Chalk helps dry a climber's hands so as to assist with grip. The drier one's hands, the better they grip. <br>
			It's like tyres, in a way. A car can have 1,000 horsepower, but it will still be slow if its tyres aren't <br>
			able to transmit that power. In the same way, a climber's grip can be very strong, but that doesn't mean a <br>
			whole lot if their hands are sweaty halfway through their 5.11 climb! <br></div>

	  <div class="text"><h4> Liquid and cream </h4>
		Let's start off with the up-and-coming chalk types: liquid and cream. Liquid and cream chalks are almost <br>
		interchangeable, seing as they're both liquid. The difference there is that cream chalks contain a <br>
		moisturizing agent, whereas liquid chalks do not; the only liquifying agent is isopropyl alcohol. When<br>
		applying liquid or cream chalks, the climber simply squirts some of the liquid into their hand, then rubs<br>
		it around and waits for it to dry. Sometimes you'll see a climber who just put on some liquid chalk <br>
		waving their hands around to help dry the chalk quicker. <br></div>

		<div class="text"><h4> Dry chalks </h4>
			Now on to the dry forms of chalk. In this category, we find loose and block chalks. As their respective <br>
			names imply, these chalks come either in a powder or in small bricks. Some may find these forms harder to <br>
			work with, and others may prefer them. Many climbing gyms have, since the pandemic, banned use of these <br>
			dry chalks in favor of the liquid chalk, due to the slight disinfecting properties of the latter. Sometimes <br>
			you'll see a small fabric sack that holds chalk and goes inside a chalk bag, which is called a chalk ball. <br>
			This is what is sometimes referred to as ball chalk. <br></div>
