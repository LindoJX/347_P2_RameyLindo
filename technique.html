		<h4> There are a lot of techniques to use in climbing </h4>
		A lot of strength in climbing comes from the forearms, as well as the legs, but, as with many sports, technique <br>
		trumps all. There are many many different moves to use in climbing, from a drop knee to straight arms to <br>
		stemming and even more. Here, we're going to be talking about the drop knee, straight arms, and hip in<br>
		techniques.

			<h4> Drop knee </h4>
			One of the most underutilized techniques, the drop knee is my personal favorite. It technically falls under <br>
			the umbrella technique of going hip in, but this is a more specific movement that deserves a spotlight. It <br>
			entails turning to the right or left (depending on which knee will drop), then rotating that knee downward <br>
			while keeping pressure on the opposite foot. This creates a compression force between the two feet, engendering<br>
			a stable base off of which the climber can push to reach the next hold.<br>
		</div>

		<div class="text-box">
			<img src="images/straightArms.jfif"  height=200 width=200 alt="Climber keeping their arms straight">
			<h4> Straight arms </h4>
			Even more self-explanatory than the drop knee technique, keeping straight arms is one of those beginner mistakes<br>
			that is generally easy to remedy. As the name implies, the technique entails just one thing; avoiding bending <br>
			the arms. Keeping the arms straight uses less energy than constantly using muscle power to pull yourself halfway<br>
			up, and energy conservation in climbing is one of the keys to becoming great. If nothing else, climbing with bent <br>
			arms makes for a situation that some climbers call "t-rexxing," for obivous reasons.<br>
		</div>

		<div class="text-box">
			<img src="images/hipIn.jfif"  height=200 width=250 alt="Climber going hip in"> &nbsp;
			<h4> Hip in </h4>
			Going hip in is a technique used to get a more desirable position on the wall, and can be performed in a variety<br>
			of ways. From the aforementioned drop knee to inside flagging, and literally just turning to the side, hip in <br>
			is used on inclined walls to take pressure off the hands and put it on the feet. Going hip in does this as well <br>
			bringing the climber physically closer to the wall, allowing them to reach further up the wall. This, of course,<br>
			helps the climber reach that one last tricky hold. <br>
