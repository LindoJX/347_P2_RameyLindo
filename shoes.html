		<h2>It's not all style</h2>

		<div class="intro">
			<h4> There are three main types of climbing shoes </h4>
			There are neutral, moderate, and aggressive climbing shoes. They get progressively thinner and more curved, features that help climbers<br>
			complete more and more technical climbs. Usually, the skill of the climber is correlated with their choice in shoe, but this is not a <br>
			hard and fast rule. Generally, a beginner will be seen in a neutral shoe, an intermediate in a moderate, and an expert in aggressives. <br>
			As alluded to before, however, this is not always the case. Sometimes a climber might prefer a pair of neutrals over moderates or <br>
			aggressives due to the better comfort they afford. This boost in comfort can lead to longer climbing sessions, and the thicker sole of <br>
			moderates or neutrals make them more resistant to wear.

			  <div class="text">The best for both beginners and seasoned veterans (in some cases), neutral shoes have almost the same shape as regular street shoes. <br>
				With next to no curve toward the inside of the feet, nor any downward at the toes, these shoes are generally designed for all-day <br>
				comfort. This sort of design makes them good for beginners, who are not used to wearing climbing shoes, and for longtime enthusiasts <br>
				or professionals looking to spend a couple hours at a time sending. These shoes also tend to have the thickest soles out of the three<br>
				types, which is another boon to beginners, who should expect to slip off holds fairly commonly.<br></div>

				<div class="text">Moderate shoes are good for beginners as well, but are more geared toward the intermediate and experienced climber. These have a more <br>
					aggressive downturn at the toes, and some curve into the inside of the foot. These features make moderate shoes better to climb in. <br>
					The two curves focus power from the foot into the big toe, and the sole has also been whittled down for a better feel on the rock<br>
					These are probably the more common type of she you'll see in a climbing gym. They offer a good balance between comfort and prowess.<br></div>

				<div class="text">Creating the best grip and most nuanced feel, aggressive shoes are, well, aggressive. Don't worry, though; they won't bite! As the <br>
					nomenclature implies, the curves on these shoes are much harsher than on the previous two. On some aggressive shoes, the toe even looks<br>
					hooked! These things, coupled with some very thin soles, make aggressive shoes the ideal shoes for those looking for that extra n'th <br>
					percent on the wall or the rock. Oftentimes, people will have to take these shoes off between every climb, just so their feet aren't <br>
					screaming at them. You'll mostly see these on highly technical routes on boulders or bouldering walls, or even short lead or top-rope<br>
					climbs. </div>
